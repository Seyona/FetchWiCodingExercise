To run this you'll need to have have the following python libraries installed
    - FastAPI (pip install FastAPI) if that doesn't work : py -m pip install FastAPI
    - uvicorn (pip install uvicorn) if that doesn't work : py -m pip install uvicorn

To run the webserver: uvicorn main:app --reload
    - You may need to use "py -m uvicorn main:app --reload"


Once everything is running you should connect and run all api queries through 127.0.0.1:8000/
    - Adding points example : http://127.0.0.1:8000/points/add/user/DANNON/200?date=10%2f31%2010AM

Alternatively,
    - Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
    - Click on the api call that you are interested in running
        - click "Try it out" in the top right
        - Enter the desired information and hit "execute"
           - This is a little easier because you can type the date string without the %2f for '/' and %20 for spaces



You can create additional users with http://127.0.0.1:8000//user/createUser/user_name , but users that are created are cleared when ever the webservice reboots
